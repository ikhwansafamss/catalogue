This repo contains a first draft of a website for Gowaart's metadata on Ikhwān al-Ṣafā manuscripts. 

Temporary website address: https://pverkind.github.io/IkhwanMss/

TO DO: 
* user customization: let user decide which columns are shown in the table? (https://datatables.net/examples/api/show_hide.html)
* separate landing page?

# Setup

For this to work, you should:

1. enable GitHub Actions with the correct permissions:

* Under your repository name (IkhwanMss), click  Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the  dropdown menu, then click Settings.
* In the left sidebar, click  Actions, then click General.
* scroll down to "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions" and press "save".

2. enable GitHub Pages:

* Under your repository name, click  Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the  dropdown menu, then click Settings.
* In the left sidebar, click  Pages
* Under "branch", choose "main", keep the default location as "root/"  and click "save"
The content of the root folder of your repo is now served under <your_github_name>.github.io/IkhwanMss
(and because we have put the index.html file in the root folder, that will be displayed by default when you go to that page)
